- **[project-name]-ontology** - a project consist of ontology which contains higher-level concepts together with detailed fine-grained concepts
- **[project-name]-kb** - a project with both ontology/scheme description and underlied data RDF graphs.
- **[project-name]-facts**  - a project with RDF knowledge graph that describes some facts on the given topic
